• This project focuses on developing a language detection 
system using machine learning and deep learning 
techniques. 

• The goal is to automatically identify the language of a 
given text input, which has applications in various fields 
such as natural language processing, machine translation, 
and text classification. 

• The project starts with data exploration and 
preprocessing, including tasks like tokenization, stopword 
removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization. 

• Subsequently, models such as Random Forest Classifier 
and Neural Network are trained on the preprocessed 
data to learn language patterns. 

• Evaluation metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and 
classification report are used to assess model 
performance. 

• Finally, a language detection function is implemented, 
allowing users to input text and predict the language with 
high accuracy.
